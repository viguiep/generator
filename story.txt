Once upon a time there was a HERO_ADJ HERO_BOY_OR_GIRL called HERO_FIRSTNAME HERO_LASTNAME. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED was on the way to see HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE FRIEND_RELATIONSHIP FRIEND_FIRSTNAME FRIEND_LASTNAME, when HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE decided to take a short cut through FOREST.

It wasn't long before HERO_FIRSTNAME got lost. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED looked around, but all HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE could see were trees. Nervously, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE felt into HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE bag for HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE favourite toy, FAVORITE_TOY, but FAVORITE_TOY was nowhere to be found! HERO_FIRSTNAME began to panic. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED felt sure HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE had packed FAVORITE_TOY. To make matters worse, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE was starting to feel hungry.

Unexpectedly, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE saw a ANIMAL_ADJ_NOT_SIZE ANIMAL_LOWERCASE dressed in a COLOR CLOTHING disappearing into the trees.

"How odd!" thought HERO_FIRSTNAME.

For the want of anything better to do, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE decided to follow the peculiarly dressed ANIMAL_LOWERCASE. Perhaps it could tell her the way out of the forest.

Eventually, HERO_FIRSTNAME reached a clearing. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from VERY_HEALTHY_FOOD, a house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_1, a house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_2 and a house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3.

HERO_FIRSTNAME could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.

"Hello!" HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE called. "Is anybody there?"

Nobody replied.

HERO_FIRSTNAME looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.

A cackle broke through the air, giving HERO_FIRSTNAME a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was FAVORITE_TOY!

"FAVORITE_TOY!" shouted HERO_FIRSTNAME. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"

The witch just shrugged.

"Give FAVORITE_TOY back!" cried HERO_FIRSTNAME.

"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.

"At least let FAVORITE_TOY out of that cage!"

Before HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE could reply, three ANIMAL_ADJ_NOT_SIZE ANIMAL_PLURAL rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. HERO_FIRSTNAME recognised the one in the COLOR CLOTHING that HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.

"Hello Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED," said the witch.

"Good morning." The ANIMAL_LOWERCASE noticed FAVORITE_TOY. "Who is this?"

"That's FAVORITE_TOY," explained the witch.

"Ooh! FAVORITE_TOY would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the ANIMAL_LOWERCASE.

The witch shook her head. "FAVORITE_TOY is staying with me."

"Um... Excuse me..." HERO_FIRSTNAME interrupted. "FAVORITE_TOY lives with me! And not in a cage!"

Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.

The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED looked at the house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3 and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3 if I wanted to."

"That's nothing," said the next ANIMAL_LOWERCASE. "I could eat two houses."

"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have FAVORITE_TOY."

HERO_FIRSTNAME watched, feeling very worried. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED didn't want the witch to give FAVORITE_TOY to Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED didn't think FAVORITE_TOY would like living with a ANIMAL_ADJ_NOT_SIZE ANIMAL_LOWERCASE, away from HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE house and all HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE other toys.

The other two ANIMAL_PLURAL watched while Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.

"I'll eat this whole house," said Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED. "Just you watch!"

Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_1. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.

   And more.

      And more.

Eventually, Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of UNHEALTHY_FOOD_1, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.

"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED.

Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.

Big ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED never finished eating the front door made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_1 and FAVORITE_TOY remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED stepped up, and approached the house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_2.

"I'll eat this whole house," said Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED. "Just you watch!"

Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_2. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.

   And more.

      And more.

After a while, Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...

   ...and greener.

A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.

"I'm not a bush, I'm a ANIMAL_LOWERCASE!" said Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED.

"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."

"No! Wait!" cried Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the ANIMAL_LOWERCASE away under his arm.

Average ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED never finished eating the front door made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_2 and FAVORITE_TOY remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED stepped up, and approached the house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3.

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED. "Just you watch!"

Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.

   And more.

      And more.

After five or six platefuls, Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.

He stopped eating UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3 for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.

But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED into the sky.

"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED. "I'm scared of heigh..."

Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED was never seen again.

Little ANIMAL_CAPITALIZED never finished eating the front door made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_3 and FAVORITE_TOY remained trapped in the witch's cage.

"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep FAVORITE_TOY."

"Not so fast," said HERO_FIRSTNAME. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from VERY_HEALTHY_FOOD. And I haven't had a turn yet.

"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."

The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the ANIMAL_PLURAL. She won't last long."

"I'll be right back," said HERO_FIRSTNAME.

"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted FAVORITE_TOY back."

HERO_FIRSTNAME ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from VERY_HEALTHY_FOOD and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED quickly devoured the whole piece.

HERO_FIRSTNAME sat down on a nearby log.

"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."

"I haven't finished," explained HERO_FIRSTNAME. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."

When HERO_FIRSTNAME's food had digested, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE broke off another piece of the door made from VERY_HEALTHY_FOOD. Once more, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE toasted HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.

Eventually, after several sittings, HERO_FIRSTNAME was down to the final piece of the door made from VERY_HEALTHY_FOOD. Carefully, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. HERO_HE_OR_SHE_CAPITALIZED finished HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE final course. HERO_FIRSTNAME had eaten the entire front door of the house made from VERY_HEALTHY_FOOD.

The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little HERO_BOY_OR_GIRL won fair and square. Now hand over FAVORITE_TOY or I will chop your broomstick in half."

The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.

HERO_FIRSTNAME hurried over and grabbed FAVORITE_TOY, checking that HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, FAVORITE_TOY was unharmed.

HERO_FIRSTNAME thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet FRIEND_FIRSTNAME. It was starting to get dark.

When HERO_FIRSTNAME got to FRIEND_FIRSTNAME's house, her threw his arms around her.

"I was so worried!" cried FRIEND_FIRSTNAME. "You are very late."

As HERO_FIRSTNAME described HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE day, HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE could tell that FRIEND_FIRSTNAME didn't believe her. So HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE grabbed a napkin from HERO_HIS_OR_HER_LOWERCASE pocket.

"What's that?" asked FRIEND_FIRSTNAME.

HERO_FIRSTNAME unwrapped a doorknob made from UNHEALTHY_FOOD_1. "Pudding!" HERO_HE_OR_SHE_LOWERCASE said.

FRIEND_FIRSTNAME almost fell off his chair.

The End
